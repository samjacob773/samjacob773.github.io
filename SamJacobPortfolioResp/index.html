      <p>I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar. That much is true.
        But even then, I knew I'd find a much better place, either with or without you
        The five years we have had have been such good times. I still love you! But now, 
        I think it's time I live my life on my own. I guess it's just what I must do.</p>
        <p>Don't, don't you want me? You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me.
        Don't, don't you want me? You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me.
        It's much too late to find, you think you've changed your mind. You'd better change it back or we will 
        both be sorry</p>
       <p> Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me? Oh! Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me? Oh...
