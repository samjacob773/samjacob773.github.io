These are the two folders for Bootcamp Coding Assignment #2.
PortfolioResp is supposed to be the RESPONSIVE portfolio.
PortfolioBoot is supposed to be the Bootcamp portfolio.

I know they were supposed to match, and look the same. I got very excited messing around with bootstrap templates and
when I removed all the bootstrap links, the website looked like a real mess.

So, I just tried to do my responsive portfolio from a more basic template.
The bootcamp portfolio is not exactly what the assignment requested. I tried to make it look nicer, but it's one page, rather than three pages.

I really really had difficulty with this assignment, and was not sure what I was doing. I just tried to make the information look better with decent presentation. My media queries were not properly added in the responsive site.
